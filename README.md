# Blinky Arcade

If you want a novel (but extremely low-resolution) way to game, this repo
is a growing collection of games to be played on RGB LED strips.

Currently the collection contains:
- Pong

# Authors
Several people have contributed to the code:
[Steven Jacobs - Python Xbox Plugin](https://github.com/FRC4564/Xbox)

# Purpose
This is currently used for [McGill Robotics](https://mcgillrobotics.com/)
outreach event. Some of our robots are equipped with LED arrays (for practical
purposes) and these games are meant to play on them.

The repo may be updated further to help support other hardware configurations.
